klamav needs clamav as a build time requirement.

If it's not installed and the source isn't available, running the SlackBuild will show the download URL and exit.

-----------

The minimum version of rust for clamav-1.5.x depends on the modules built.
For version 1.5.1, minimum rust versions range up to 1.85.0

As set up here, the build was successful with rust-1.85.0
