Chalk/krita will crash trying to load PNGs it saved if it is built with libpng-1.6.

The patch included with the SlackBuild is a workaround until koffice issue 20 has been fixed.

If it is necessary to convert the image to the RGB working space, there are a number of profiles installed with {chalk,krita} in <TDE-installation-directory>/share/apps/{chalk,krita}/profiles/ which can be installed with Imagemagick's 'convert', or GraphicsMagick's 'gm convert'

Example:
"""""""
in=<path-to>/original.png    # existing
out=<path-to>/converted.png  # will be created
profile=<TDE-installation-directory>/share/apps/{chalk,krita}/profiles/srgb_color_space_profile.icm
convert='gm convert'
($convert $in -profile $profile $out)
