The Kalzium Chemical Equation Solver needs OCaml, and the FaCiLe module.

tdeedu.SlackBuild checks whether ocaml *and* facile are installed. If not, and the source archives are in the 'src' directory, they are then built, packaged, and installed.

Download from:
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.05.0.tar.gz
http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/facile/distrib/facile-1.1.3.tar.gz

As I'm not aware of any other uses, the builds have not been added to the build list and the source archives will have to be downloaded manually prior to the build. I believe that ocaml and facile are only build-time requirements and if so can be removed when the tdeedu build has completed - but won't know for sure until the crash has been fixed.

If kalzium crashes when trying to use the equation solver, there is an open issue @ https://mirror.git.trinitydesktop.org/gitea/TDE/tdeedu/issues/8.

If it works for you, or the crash is caused by a problem with the build, please raise an issue here to let me know.
