(Installing tdebase)
In line with normal practice, tdmrc will not be overwritten and tdmrc.new will be installed for admin decision on whether to use it as tdmrc. Where tdmrc doesn't exist, it will be created by doinst.sh from tdmrc.new.

(root logins)
AllowRootLogin is set to true in tdmrc.new, and will therefore be the default for new installations.

(rc.4.local)
This has been included on the assumption that the standard entry in rc.4[.new] from the package sysvinit-scripts exists:

    # If you'd like to start something different or in a
    # different order than the options below, create your
    # own startup script /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local and make it
    # executable and it will be used instead:
        if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local ]; then
          exec /bin/bash /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local
        fi

To enable TDM if this isn't the case, either
[1] add this test to rc.4 above other session manager options
or
[2] copy the contents of rc.4.local to rc.4 above other session manager options
