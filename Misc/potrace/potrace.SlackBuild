# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The 'handy ruler' below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

$PRGNAM: Potrace is a backend for Potracegui.
$PRGNAM:
$PRGNAM: Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap - transforming it into a smooth
$PRGNAM: scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP), and
$PRGNAM: the default output is one of several vector file formats: EPS,
$PRGNAM: PostScript, PDF, SVG, DXF, GeoJSON, Gimppath, XFig, and PGM (for easy
$PRGNAM: antialiasing of pixel-based images).
$PRGNAM:
$PRGNAM: A separate program, mkbitmap, can act as a pre-processor for Potrace,
$PRGNAM: applying scaling and various filters to an image before converting it
$PRGNAM: to a bitmap. This is useful for potracing greyscale and color images.
