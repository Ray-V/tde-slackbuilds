# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The 'handy ruler' below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

$PRGNAM: GraphicsMagick (The swiss army knife of image processing)
$PRGNAM:
$PRGNAM: GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. Comprised
$PRGNAM: of 265K physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler's
$PRGNAM: SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 1,220K including
$PRGNAM: 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient collection of
$PRGNAM: tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and manipulating
$PRGNAM: an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like
$PRGNAM: DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.
