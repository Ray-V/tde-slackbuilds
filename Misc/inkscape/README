inkscape v1.0.2 requires non-Slackware packages gdl and double-conversion.

The sources will need to be pre-downloaded and placed in the 'src' directory and will then be built, packaged, and installed during the inkscape build.

The URLs will be displayed when running the SlackBuild if the installations or sources aren't found.
