Inkscape v1 requires the non-Slackware package double-conversion.

If the installation or source isn't found, the download URL will be displayed when running the SlackBuild.

The source will need to be pre-downloaded to the 'src' directory and will then be built, packaged, and installed during the inkscape build.

-----------------

Build errors might occur for v1.4 relating to glibmm and pangomm.
gcc and clang requirements are different, but in either case, minimum versions of glibmm-2.66.5 and pangomm-2.46.3 will enable a successful build.
