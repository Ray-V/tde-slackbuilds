Inkscape v1 requires the non-Slackware package double-conversion.

If the installation or source isn't found, the download URL will be displayed when running the SlackBuild.

The source will need to be pre-downloaded to the 'src' directory and will then be built, packaged, and installed during the inkscape build.
